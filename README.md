# Now Weâ€™re Cookin


## Description

We created a website to make cooking more convenient. On the landing page, the user is able to search any ingredient they wish to cook with. The results page displays recipes including that ingredient. The user is then able to choose a recipe, which sends the user to the website containing the information.

We also included a feature to search for a grocery store near the user. If the user wishes, they can locate a nearby grocery store if they are in need of additional ingredients to complete their recipe.

By creating this website, we wanted to solve the problem of time being wasted on deciding what to cook/eat. The user can now pick any item in their kitchen and enter it into the website. From there, they can choose what recipe they are in the mood for, all based on an ingredient they already have.
Additionally, if the user comes across the issue of not having all of the ingredients to complete the recipe, they are able to map themselves to the nearest grocery store on the same results page they found their recipes.

Our Website uses Google Maps API to fetch grocery store data based on the grocery store name entered by the user. We also used the Edamam API to create a list of recipes to be used based off of the ingredient entered by the user.

This project was created with Javascript, Materialize, jQuery, HTML and CSS.
Together as a team we learned how to collaborate on design and functionality. We learned how to properly commit our code in an organized matter so we were always up to date, without conflicts.

## Usage

When you arrive at the landing page, enter in an ingredient of your choosing.
From there, you will be sent to the results page where you are able to choose from a list of recipes.

On the results page, you may also search for a grocery store nearby using the name of a grocery store.

Ensure you allow your location to be shared in order to see the Google Maps!
